1. Setup Dependencies
You will need several Python libraries and tools for system monitoring, network traffic capture, and malware execution. Install the following dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install psutil pyshark watchdog yara-python
2. Malware Execution Script
This script automatically executes malware samples from a directory, logs any errors, and proceeds with the next sample.

python
Copy
import subprocess
import time
import os

# Directory containing malware samples
MALWARE_DIR = "/path/to/malware/samples"

# Function to execute malware sample
def execute_sample(file_path):
    try:
        print(f"Executing {file_path}...")
        # Run the malware sample with a timeout of 60 seconds
        subprocess.run([file_path], timeout=60, check=True)
    except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
        print(f"Timeout expired for {file_path}")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error executing {file_path}: {e}")

# Loop through malware samples and execute
def analyze_malware():
    for sample in os.listdir(MALWARE_DIR):
        sample_path = os.path.join(MALWARE_DIR, sample)
        if os.path.isfile(sample_path):
            execute_sample(sample_path)
            time.sleep(5)  # Wait before executing the next sample

if __name__ == "__main__":
    analyze_malware()
This will execute all files found in the MALWARE_DIR directory.

3. File System Monitoring with Watchdog
This script monitors file system changes (new file creations, modifications) during malware execution using the watchdog library.

python
Copy
from watchdog.observers import Observer
from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler
import time

class MalwareFileHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):
    def on_modified(self, event):
        if event.is_directory:
            return
        print(f"File modified: {event.src_path}")

    def on_created(self, event):
        if event.is_directory:
            return
        print(f"New file created: {event.src_path}")

# Initialize Observer to watch the root directory (or target directory)
observer = Observer()
event_handler = MalwareFileHandler()
observer.schedule(event_handler, path="/", recursive=True)
observer.start()

try:
    while True:
        time.sleep(1)  # Keep monitoring
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    observer.stop()
observer.join()
This script monitors all directories and reports any new or modified files during malware execution. Adjust the path parameter to specify specific directories.

4. Network Monitoring with Pyshark
This script uses pyshark (a wrapper around Wireshark) to capture and display network packets during malware execution. It can identify network activity such as outbound connections.

python
Copy
import pyshark

def monitor_network():
    # Capture packets on the network (change the interface to your local network interface)
    capture = pyshark.LiveCapture(interface='eth0')  # Use the correct interface name
    for packet in capture.sniff_continuously():
        print(packet)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    monitor_network()
This script will display all network packets captured during the analysis. Replace eth0 with your network interface (you can use ifconfig or ip a to find it).

5. YARA Rule for Signature-Based Detection
YARA allows you to detect known malware based on certain patterns. Hereâ€™s an example of a simple YARA rule and Python integration to scan files for known signatures.

Example YARA Rule (malware_rules.yar):

yara
Copy
rule ExampleMalware
{
    meta:
        description = "Detect Example Malware"
        author = "Your Name"
        date = "2025-03-01"

    strings:
        $malware_string = "malicious_code"
        $malware_pattern = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B }

    condition:
        $malware_string or $malware_pattern
}
To run YARA scans against malware samples:

python
Copy
import yara
import os

def scan_with_yara(file_path):
    rules = yara.compile(filepath='malware_rules.yar')
    matches = rules.match(file_path)
    if matches:
        print(f"YARA match found for {file_path}: {matches}")

# Run YARA scan on all files in the malware directory
MALWARE_DIR = "/path/to/malware/samples"
for sample in os.listdir(MALWARE_DIR):
    sample_path = os.path.join(MALWARE_DIR, sample)
    scan_with_yara(sample_path)
This script will scan all malware samples using the defined YARA rules and print matches.

6. Automated Report Generation
After running the analysis, you can automatically generate a detailed report on the activities detected during the analysis (file changes, network activity, YARA matches).

python
Copy
import datetime

def generate_report(file_changes, network_activity, yara_matches):
    report = {
        "timestamp": str(datetime.datetime.now()),
        "file_changes": file_changes,
        "network_activity": network_activity,
        "yara_matches": yara_matches,
    }

    # Save the report to a text file
    with open("malware_analysis_report.txt", "w") as report_file:
        for key, value in report.items():
            report_file.write(f"{key}: {value}\n")
    print("Report generated: malware_analysis_report.txt")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example of collected data (in a real system, this will be dynamically populated)
    file_changes = [
        "New file created: malware.exe",
        "File modified: system32.dll",
    ]
    network_activity = [
        "Outbound connection to 192.168.1.100:443",
        "DNS request to malicious-site.com",
    ]
    yara_matches = [
        "YARA match found for sample1.exe",
    ]

    # Generate and save the report
    generate_report(file_changes, network_activity, yara_matches)
This script generates a report with file system changes, network activity, and YARA matches.

7. Email Alert (Optional)
You can set up email alerts for suspicious activity (e.g., a network connection to a C2 server or a YARA match). This example uses smtplib to send email alerts.

python
Copy
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def send_alert(message):
    msg = MIMEText(message)
    msg['Subject'] = 'Malware Analysis Alert'
    msg['From'] = 'youremail@example.com'
    msg['To'] = 'recipient@example.com'

    # Send email via SMTP server
    with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.example.com', 587) as server:
        server.login('youremail@example.com', 'password')
        server.sendmail(msg['From'], [msg['To']], msg.as_string())
        print("Alert sent!")

# Trigger an alert if suspicious activity is detected
send_alert("Suspicious activity detected: Malware outbound connection to 192.168.1.100")
This script sends an email alert when suspicious activity (like a connection to a C2 server) is detected.

8. Putting It All Together
To make the system fully automated, combine all the scripts into a cohesive workflow:

Execute Malware Samples: Run the execution script.
Monitor System Changes: Simultaneously, run the file system monitoring script.
Capture Network Traffic: Run the network monitoring script.
Run YARA Signature Detection: Continuously scan the samples with YARA.
Generate Report: After analysis, generate the report automatically.
Send Alerts: If critical activity is detected, send an email alert.
Conclusion
This automated malware analysis system is designed to:

Execute malware samples in an isolated environment.
Continuously monitor file changes, network activity, and process execution.
Use YARA rules to detect known malware.
Generate detailed analysis reports.
Optionally send alerts when suspicious activity is detected.
By automating the analysis of malware, you can save time and efficiently analyze large volumes of malware samples in a safe, controlled environment.
