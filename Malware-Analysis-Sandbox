# Automated Malware Analysis Sandbox

This repository contains a fully automated malware analysis sandbox that uses virtual machines or Docker containers to analyze suspicious files in isolation. The system automatically executes files, monitors system changes (files, registry, network), and generates a comprehensive report.

## Features:
- **Isolation**: Runs malware samples in a fully isolated environment (VM or Docker).
- **Behavior Monitoring**: Tracks file system changes, registry modifications, and network connections.
- **Automated Report Generation**: Generates reports with key findings like IP addresses, file hashes, and C2 server communication.

## Setup Instructions:
1. Set up **VirtualBox** or **Docker** to create an isolated environment.
2. Clone the repository and configure the sandbox.
3. Place malware samples in the `samples` directory and run `sandbox.py` to start analysis.
4. Review the generated report in the `output` folder.

## How It Works:
- **VM/Docker Isolation**: The malware is executed in a controlled environment to prevent damage.
- **Behavioral Monitoring**: Uses tools like **Procmon** and **Wireshark** to capture changes during execution.
- **Report Generation**: The system outputs a detailed report of all suspicious activities observed.
