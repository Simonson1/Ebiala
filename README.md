# Advanced Penetration Testing Framework

This project is a custom penetration testing framework that automates several steps of the penetration testing lifecycle, including scanning, exploitation, and reporting. It integrates popular tools like Metasploit, Nmap, and Burp Suite.

## Features:
- **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**: Leverages Nmap to scan open ports and services.
- **Exploitation Automation**: Uses Metasploit for exploit automation.
- **Reporting**: Generates detailed vulnerability reports based on findings.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up necessary tools (Metasploit, Burp Suite).
3. Run the `penTestFramework.py` script to begin automated scanning.
4. Review the generated report in `output/report.txt`.

## Tools Integrated:
- **Metasploit** for exploitation.
- **Nmap** for network scanning.
- **Burp Suite** for web application security testing.
